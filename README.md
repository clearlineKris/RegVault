# ClearLine-RegForge: Cannabis Market Regulatory Analysis

This repository provides in-depth regulatory research and guidance on cannabis markets across the United States, with a focus on the "penumbra of cannabis law"—gray areas, ambiguities, and unclear aspects of cannabis regulations.

## Market Coverage Roadmap

We are systematically expanding coverage to all major U.S. cannabis markets. Each quarter, we add detailed analysis for 5 new markets, including both Penumbrant Papers and ORA Reports.

## Current Coverage

### Penumbrant Papers

### ORA Reports

## Q1 2026: Upcoming Markets (Coming Soon)

### California (CA)
**Teaser**: California's dual-licensing system creates uncertainty about which activities require state versus local approval. The state's 400+ local jurisdictions each interpret "reasonable regulation" differently, creating a patchwork of contradictory compliance requirements.

### Washington (WA)
**Teaser**: Washington prohibits medical and adult-use license stacking, but the definition of "true party of interest" remains ambiguous. This creates gray areas around permissible financial relationships and ownership structures.

### Oregon (OR)
**Teaser**: Oregon regulations are silent on whether testing labs can reject samples for unstated quality concerns. This enforcement gap allows inconsistent application of safety standards across the state's fragmented testing infrastructure.

### Nevada (NV)
**Teaser**: Nevada's consumption lounge regulations leave "supervision" requirements undefined, creating uncertainty about staffing and liability. Operators face ambiguity about what constitutes adequate monitoring of on-site consumption.

### Illinois (IL)
**Teaser**: Illinois's "true party of interest" rules prohibit undisclosed control but don't define what constitutes "control." Management agreements, consulting contracts, and financing arrangements exist in regulatory gray areas.

## Q2 2026: Upcoming Markets (Coming Soon)

### Michigan (MI)
**Teaser**: Michigan's stacking prohibition creates ambiguity about when separate legal entities constitute impermissible common control. The statute doesn't clarify how family relationships or shared investors affect license eligibility.

### Massachusetts (MA)
**Teaser**: Massachusetts requires "host community agreements" but provides no statutory limits on municipal demands. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes an "unreasonable" local requirement beyond the 3% impact fee cap.

### Arizona (AZ)
**Teaser**: Arizona's Proposition 207 grants existing medical dispensaries "dual licensure" but leaves scope of operations undefined. The penumbra around whether dual licenses can exceed single-license canopy limits remains unresolved.

### New Jersey (NJ)
**Teaser**: New Jersey's "diversification" requirement mandates ownership representation but doesn't define qualifying criteria. This ambiguity affects how operators demonstrate compliance with social equity ownership goals.

### New York (NY)
**Teaser**: New York's CAURD program prioritizes "justice-involved" applicants but the statute lacks clear criteria for evaluating claims. Eligibility disputes arise from ambiguous definitions of cannabis-related convictions and their connection to applicants.

---

## Q3 2026: Upcoming Markets (Coming Soon)

### Pennsylvania (PA)
**Teaser**: Pennsylvania's medical program requires physician "certification" rather than "recommendation," creating ambiguity about the clinical standard required. This distinction affects liability exposure and the physician-patient relationship in ways unaddressed by regulations.

### Maryland (MD)
**Teaser**: Maryland's transition rules allow medical dispensaries to convert to adult-use but don't specify priority rights. This creates uncertainty about whether conversion applicants have preferential status over new entrants.

### Connecticut (CT)
**Teaser**: Connecticut's social equity lottery system lacks defined scoring criteria for "disproportionate impact" areas. Applicants face uncertainty about how residency and conviction history are weighted in the selection process.

### Rhode Island (RI)
**Teaser**: Rhode Island's "hybrid license" allows compassion centers to serve both markets but doesn't define required operational separation. The degree of mandated segregation between medical and adult-use operations remains unclear.

### Montana (MT)
**Teaser**: Montana's county-level opt-out provision leaves the definition of "opt-out" ambiguous. Counties face uncertainty about whether they can ban specific license types while permitting others.

---

## Q4 2026: Upcoming Markets (Coming Soon)

### Alaska (AK)
**Teaser**: Alaska's on-site consumption endorsement regulations don't specify ventilation or separation standards. Operators lack clear guidance on facility requirements for consumption areas adjacent to retail operations.

### Maine (ME)
**Teaser**: Maine's caregiver program allows "designated caregivers" to cultivate for patients but doesn't define permissible compensation. The line between lawful caregiver activity and unlicensed commercial operation remains ambiguous.

### Vermont (VT)
**Teaser**: Vermont allows home cultivation but regulations don't address "gifting" between adults. This creates gray areas around what constitutes permissible personal transfer versus illegal distribution.

### New Mexico (NM)
**Teaser**: New Mexico's microbusiness license limits production but doesn't define "small-scale" cultivation thresholds. Operators face uncertainty about when growth triggers reclassification to standard producer status.

### Missouri (MO)
**Teaser**: Missouri's constitutional amendment limits local authority but doesn't specify how "reasonable restrictions" are defined. Municipalities and operators clash over what constitutes permissible versus prohibited local regulation.

## About This Repository

**Penumbrant Papers** provide in-depth research on the "penumbra of cannabis law"—the gray areas, ambiguities, and unarticulated implications of cannabis regulations where the law is unclear, unwritten, or subject to interpretation.

**ORA Reports** examine Operator-Regulator Asymmetry, analyzing how regulatory ambiguity disproportionately affects cannabis operators and creates operational challenges.
