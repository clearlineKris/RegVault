### Teaser

Nevada built a cannabis program designed to serve tourists, but **operational reality reveals fundamental tensions between high-volume retail, transient customers, and stringent compliance requirements.** How do Las Vegas dispensaries actually work?

From tourist purchase verification to consumption lounge impossibilities, Nevada operators face unique operational challenges that regulations didn't fully anticipate. This Field Notes document explores:

- **Tourist ID Verification**: Regulations require age verification, but what about international passports, expired IDs, and tourists who "lost" their identification? Operational protocols vs. technical compliance
- **High-Volume Retail Operations**: Strip dispensaries serve thousands of customers per day, but POS systems, inventory tracking, and staffing requirements assume boutique retail models
- **Consumption Lounge Paradox**: Authorized by statute but effectively impossible to open due to ventilation requirements, local approval hurdles, and federal concerns. What's the operational pathway forward?
- **Delivery Service Realities**: Legally permitted but operationally constrained by banking, insurance, and residency verification requirements
- **Distribution License Requirements**: Unique to Nevada, the mandatory distributor license creates operational bottlenecks when product movement needs to be rapid
- **Security Requirements vs. Customer Experience**: Vault storage and surveillance requirements meet tourist-friendly retail design. How do you create Vegas-style experience with pharmaceutical-grade security?

**Nevada's challenge**: Serve a global customer base while maintaining compliance standards designed for local, known customers.
