### Teaser

Illinois launched adult-use cannabis with the nation's most ambitious social equity program, but **creating opportunity through regulation requires operators to navigate complex scoring systems, conditional licenses, and operational restrictions designed for policy goals, not efficiency.**

From craft grow limitations to social equity verification protocols, Illinois operators face unique challenges where progressive policy creates operational friction. This Field Notes document examines:

- **Social Equity Documentation Requirements**: Applications require extensive documentation, but what satisfies regulators varies by reviewer. How do applicants prove qualifying factors without standardized verification?
- **Conditional License Operational Paradox**: Thousands of conditional licenses exist, but operators can't operate without annual licenses, and annual licenses require expensive infrastructure. How do startups bridge this capital gap?
- **Craft Grow Scale Economics**: Designed to promote small operators, but wholesale market access and processing relationships require scale. Can craft grows be economically viable?
- **BioTrack System Realities**: Illinois's tracking system requires specific workflows, but cultivation and processing operations don't naturally fit those workflows. Where do operators compromise?
- **Transport Timing Requirements**: Manifests and route planning meet Chicago traffic and multi-stop delivery routes. How do operators maintain compliance while serving diverse geography?
- **True Party of Interest Disclosure**: Regulations aim to prevent hidden ownership, but complex business structures and investor relationships create disclosure challenges. What's complete and accurate documentation?

**Illinois's experiment**: Progressive policy goals requiring sophisticated operational and compliance infrastructure to implement.
