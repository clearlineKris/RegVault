### Teaser

California's cannabis industry operates under **three state agencies, dozens of county ordinances, and hundreds of municipal codes—all with different interpretations, different timelines, and different enforcement priorities.** How do operators actually navigate this?

From METRC implementation disasters to conflicting agency guidance, California operators have developed sophisticated systems for managing regulatory chaos. This Field Notes document investigates:

- **Multi-Agency Inspection Conflicts**: DCC says one thing, CDPH says another, and CDFA has a third opinion. When inspectors from different agencies give conflicting direction, what does an operator actually do?
- **METRC Data Entry Realities**: The system requires precise inputs, but cultivation yields vary, processing creates waste, and sampling removes product. How do operators maintain accurate inventory when estimation is inevitable?
- **Testing Retest Protocols**: Regulations allow retesting, but how many attempts? What if COA results vary by 20% between labs? When does "retesting" become "lab shopping"?
- **Provisional-to-Annual Transition**: Years of provisional licenses created operational precedents, but annual licenses have different requirements. Do existing operations get grandfathered?
- **Delivery Driver Requirements**: Each municipality has different rules for delivery operations, and drivers cross multiple jurisdictions per shift. Whose rules apply during transit?
- **Local vs. State Conflicts**: When a city's zoning or operational requirements contradict state regulations, and the operator is caught between impossible compliance standards

**California's reality**: Successful operators employ dedicated compliance teams that do nothing but interpret and reconcile conflicting regulatory requirements.
