**Focus:** Operational Practice vs. Regulatory Requirements

### Teaser

Colorado wrote the rulebook for legal cannabis, but **a decade of operational experience has revealed systematic gaps between what regulations require and what operators can actually accomplish.** This isn't about noncompliance—it's about regulations that didn't anticipate real-world operational constraints.

From inventory tracking that assumes perfect record-keeping to testing requirements that don't account for supply chain timing, Colorado operators navigate daily disconnects between regulatory ideals and operational realities. This Field Notes document examines:

- **Metrc Timing vs. Operational Flow**: Regulations require same-day inventory updates, but facility operations, system downtime, and batch processing create inevitable delays. How do operators bridge this gap?
- **Testing Turnaround Requirements**: Regulations assume 24-48 hour lab results, but actual turnaround times run 5-7 days during peak season. What happens to product during testing limbo?
- **Physical Security vs. Customer Experience**: Vault storage requirements meet retail display needs—can you create an inviting retail environment while treating products like controlled pharmaceuticals?
- **Transport Window Compliance**: Manifests require specific pickup/delivery windows, but Colorado traffic, weather, and multiple-stop routes make precise timing impossible
- **Waste Disposal Reality Check**: Regulations mandate rendering cannabis "unusable and unrecognizable" but don't account for the physical challenges of processing large-scale waste
- **Employee Badge Timing**: Background checks take 2-4 weeks, but operational needs require immediate staffing. How do operators manage training and probationary periods?

**The takeaway**: Colorado's operators have developed workarounds, best practices, and informal protocols that make the system work despite regulatory-operational mismatches.
