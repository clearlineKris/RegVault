### Teaser

Washington's seed-to-sale tracking system is the most comprehensive in the nation, but **perfect traceability assumes perfect growing conditions, perfect system uptime, and perfect human performance.** Real cultivation and processing don't work that way.

From RFID tags that fail in high-humidity environments to 24-hour manifesting requirements that don't account for weekend operations, Washington operators face constant tension between compliance and operational reality. This Field Notes document explores:

- **RFID Tag Failure Rates**: Tags must be attached to plants, but humidity, heat, and physical handling create 5-10% failure rates. How do operators manage retagging without creating compliance violations?
- **24-Hour Manifest Windows**: Regulations require manifests within 24 hours, but the LeafData system goes down for maintenance, weekend transfers occur, and rural areas lack reliable internet
- **Plant Count vs. Plant Health**: Every plant must be tagged and tracked, but experienced cultivators know that 10-15% of plants will fail. When do you destroy a struggling plant without triggering inventory discrepancies?
- **Processing Batch Sizes**: Regulations assume standard batch sizes, but artisanal processing, equipment capacity, and strain-specific considerations create infinite variations
- **Quality Assurance Testing**: QA testing doesn't require inventory adjustments, but the line between QA and sampling is unclear when product consumption is involved
- **Harvest Window Realities**: Regulations set harvest reporting timelines, but trichome maturity doesn't wait for administrative convenience. Can you harvest optimally while staying compliant?

**Washington's lesson**: The most detailed tracking system in the world still requires human judgment and operational flexibility to function.
