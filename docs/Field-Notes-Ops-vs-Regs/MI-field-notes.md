### Teaser

Michigan's cannabis market grew faster than regulators could adapt, creating an environment where **operators pioneered operational models before regulations could define them.** The result: innovative operations and regulatory catch-up.

From caregiver market transitions to stacked licensing complexities, Michigan operators work in an environment of rapid change and regulatory improvisation. This Field Notes document explores:

- **Caregiver-to-Commercial Transitions**: Medical caregivers operated for years before adult-use, and many transitioned to licensed operations. How do informal cultivation practices adapt to commercial compliance requirements?
- **Stacked License Operations**: Class C licenses allow three of each license type, but what constitutes truly separate operations vs. integrated facilities? Where do operators draw operational lines?
- **Microbusiness Operational Models**: Vertical integration in one license sounds efficient, but self-supply restrictions and sourcing requirements create puzzles. Can you optimize operations while staying compliant?
- **Metrc Implementation Timing**: Operators built businesses on different tracking systems, and migrating to Metrc mid-operation creates data reconciliation challenges
- **Temporary License Indefinite Operations**: Designed as short-term, but many operators work on temporary licenses for years. Which rules apply? How do you plan long-term while technically temporary?
- **Municipal Opt-In Volatility**: Communities can change their cannabis policies, and existing operations face uncertainty. How do operators invest in infrastructure with uncertain local support?

**Michigan's speed**: Creating opportunities but requiring operators to build compliance infrastructure while running at full speed.
