### Teaser

Oregon's regulatory framework was designed for a supply-constrained market, but **the state now has chronic oversupply, with wholesale prices at historic lows.** Regulations written for scarcity make little sense in conditions of abundance.

From mandatory waste protocols for product worth pennies to testing requirements that cost more than the product value, Oregon operators face unique operational challenges. This Field Notes document examines:

- **Waste Disposal Economics**: Regulations require rendering product "unusable," but when wholesale prices drop below $100/pound, destroying inventory becomes more expensive than the product's market value
- **Testing Cost vs. Product Value**: Batch testing costs $500-800, but the product might wholesale for $400. How do operators make this math work?
- **Storage Space Requirements**: Regulations assume products move quickly, but oversupply means operators store product for months. When does compliant storage become economically impossible?
- **Harvest Batch Sizes**: CTS requires specific batch definitions, but when oversupply makes immediate processing uneconomical, how do operators manage large harvests?
- **Commingling Realities**: Oregon allows more processing flexibility than most states, but tracking requirements vs. efficiency gains create constant judgment calls
- **Wholesale Price Documentation**: Regulations reference "market rate," but what's market rate when prices vary from $50-$500/pound depending on quality, relationship, and desperation?

**Oregon's paradox**: A mature market with rational economic incentives operating under regulations designed for artificial scarcity.
