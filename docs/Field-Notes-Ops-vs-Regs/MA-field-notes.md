### Teaser

Massachusetts designed one of the most progressive cannabis programs in the nation, with detailed social equity provisions and comprehensive regulatory oversight. But **progressive intentions don't always translate to operational clarity.**

From host community agreement negotiations to priority licensing contradictions, Massachusetts operators navigate a framework where policy goals create unexpected operational challenges. This Field Notes document investigates:

- **Host Community Agreement Negotiations**: Regulations provide guidelines, but actual negotiations vary wildly by municipality. What's "reasonable" in Boston vs. rural communities?
- **Social Equity Priority Implementation**: Priority applicants receive expedited review, but when communities limit licenses or require expensive infrastructure, what does priority actually mean?
- **Medical-Adult-Use Co-Location**: Regulations allow it, but operational realities of separate inventory, separate POS, and patient priority access create facility design puzzles
- **Testing Lab Bottlenecks**: ISO certification is mandatory, but limited lab capacity means 2-3 week turnaround times. How do operators manage inventory during extended testing periods?
- **Delivery-Only Operations**: Regulatory framework exists, but storage facility requirements, sourcing restrictions, and local approval create operational barriers
- **Seed-to-Sale Transition Challenges**: Metrc implementation replaced vendor-specific systems, and operators are still adapting workflows to new tracking requirements

**Massachusetts's model**: Thoughtful regulation creating unintended operational complexity that requires sophisticated compliance infrastructure.
