### Teaser

Nevada built its cannabis program with a unique constraint: **serve 50+ million annual tourists while maintaining one of the strictest residency and consumption restrictions in the nation.** The result? A regulatory framework filled with fascinating contradictions and enforcement gray areas.

From Las Vegas Strip dispensaries serving global visitors to consumption lounges that technically can't exist, Nevada's regulations create a complex dance between tourism revenue and federal concerns. This Margin Notes document examines:

- **Consumption Lounge Limbo**: Nevada authorized consumption lounges, but licensing requirements, local ordinances, and ventilation standards create near-impossible conditions. What's the path to compliance?
- **Distribution Monopoly Mechanics**: The unique distribution license requirement and its impact on vertical integration—when does ownership cross the line?
- **Tourist Purchase Tracking**: Visitors can buy cannabis but have nowhere legal to consume it. How do retailers navigate this obvious disconnect?
- **Delivery Service Restrictions**: Theoretically legal, but the residency verification and banking challenges create operational puzzles
- **Medical vs. Adult-Use Ambiguities**: When patients and recreational customers share the same retail space, which rules govern?
- **Clark County Complications**: When Las Vegas-area rules diverge from state requirements, and when tourism-focused policies conflict with residential neighborhoods

**Nevada's challenge**: Creating a visitor-friendly framework without creating federal intervention triggers or local opposition.
