### Teaser

Oregon's cannabis program has produced the unexpected: **a mature market with chronic oversupply, leading to regulatory experiments that exist nowhere else in the nation.** From wholesale cannabis exports (theoretically) to unprecedented price compression, Oregon is navigating uncharted waters.

What happens when supply vastly exceeds demand in a closed system? Oregon's answer: improvise, adapt, and create regulatory gray areas that would make other states' regulators uncomfortable. This Margin Notes document explores:

- **Interstate Transfer Ambiguities**: Oregon passed laws allowing exports to other legal states... if federal law allowed it. What does this theoretical framework mean for current operations?
- **Processor-Producer Relationships**: The blurring lines between independent producers and processor-owned grows—when does a supply agreement become prohibited control?
- **Wholesale Price Realities**: How low can wholesale prices go before the regulatory definition of "market rate" loses all meaning?
- **Commingling Rules**: Oregon's unique approach to harvest batches and processing pooling—where do batch tracking requirements end and practical manufacturing begin?
- **Outdoor Cultivation Limits**: The penumbra between allowable outdoor canopy and what local agricultural zoning actually permits
- **Waste Disposal Protocols**: When oversupply meets waste requirements, and destroying valuable product becomes routine

**Oregon represents a crucible**: The regulatory experiments here preview challenges other mature markets will eventually face.
