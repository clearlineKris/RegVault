### Teaser

Michigan's cannabis market exploded faster than almost any state in history, growing from medical-only to one of the largest adult-use markets in just a few years. But **rapid expansion reveals every crack in a regulatory framework, and Michigan is discovering them in real-time.**

From caregiver-to-commercial transitions to emergency rule changes, the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency is building the airplane while flying it. This Margin Notes document explores:

- **Caregiver Market Overlap**: The medical caregiver system continues alongside the regulated market—when do home grows and patient transfers cross into prohibited commercial activity?
- **Stacked Licensing Ambiguities**: Michigan allows Class C licensees to stack three licenses per type, but what constitutes separate operations vs. prohibited integration?
- **Microbusiness Mixed Signals**: Retail, cultivation, and processing under one license sounds simple, but sourcing requirements and self-supply restrictions create operational puzzles
- **Temporary Licenses**: Operating for years on provisional approvals—which rules apply, and when does "temporary" become permanent?
- **Transfer of Ownership Gray Areas**: When application-to-license-to-sale transfers must be approved by CRA, and what documentation proves clean transfers?
- **Municipal Opt-In Dynamics**: When local approval is required but municipalities can revoke or modify terms—what happens to existing operations?

**Michigan's speed**: Creating opportunities for early movers but regulatory uncertainty for everyone.
