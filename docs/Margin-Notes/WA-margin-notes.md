### Teaser

Washington State pioneered seed-to-sale tracking with an intensity that redefined cannabis regulation. But in building the most comprehensive traceability system in the nation, **the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board created layers of ambiguity where perfect tracking meets imperfect reality.**

From mandatory RFID tags to 24-hour compliance windows, Washington's framework is simultaneously the most detailed and the most confusing in the country. This Margin Notes document illuminates:

- **The 24-Hour Manifesting Mystery**: When do transport manifests need to be created? The regulations provide timeframes, but system limitations and enforcement discretion tell different stories
- **Failed Plant Protocols**: What counts as a "failed" plant, and when can it be destroyed? The penumbra between normal attrition and inventory management violations
- **Processing License Ambiguities**: Can a processor create a new product type without explicit approval? Where testing requirements meet innovative product development
- **Quality Assurance vs. Sampling**: The blurry line between QA testing that doesn't require inventory adjustments and sampling that does
- **Inter-License Relationships**: The undefined boundaries of "common ownership" and when technical compliance crosses into prohibited financial interest

**The stakes are high**: Washington's compliance violations can trigger emergency license suspensions, making gray area navigation critical for operational survival.
