# Clearline Regulatory Intelligence (Penumbrant Pass Portal)

## Introduction
Clearline Regulatory Intelligence is the commercial backbone behind the Penumbrant Pass Portal. We package two complementary compliance mindsets:

- **Penumbrant**: Human-led pattern spotting that surfaces gray areas, unarticulated obligations, and enforcement drift so operators can navigate ambiguity with confidence.
- **LOTL (Letter of the Law)**: Rigorously cited, black-letter coverage that documents what the statute, rule, or bulletin literally requires—no more, no less.

Together they create a **dual-vision toolkit** for cannabis operators, counsel, and regulators who need to see both the safe harbor and the penumbra. This repo is your preview library: free briefs, methodology explainers, and product previews that show how we turn regulatory confusion into operator-ready guidance.

## What you get here
- **Free resources**: Executive briefs by state, LOTL stack samples, and full manual showcases that demonstrate how we translate raw law into usable playbooks.
- **Product previews**: Side-by-side Penumbrant vs LOTL views, plus glimpses of our regional, regulatory-policy, topical, and “Lil LOTL” offerings.
- **State catalog**: A live matrix of coverage so teams can see what’s available before purchasing.
- **Purchase hub**: Direct Gumroad links to buy the exact playbook or manual you need.

## Differentiation: Penumbrant vs LOTL
| Dimension | Penumbrant (Gray) | LOTL (Black Letter) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Objective | Expose ambiguities, enforcement drift, and asymmetries | Document the literal obligations and citations |
| Output Style | Narrative analysis, scenario stress-tests, operator translation | Structured statutory/rule excerpts, clause-level checklists |
| Best For | Market entry, audits, regulator dialogues, risk mapping | SOP builds, evidence files, training binders, formal reviews |
| Evidence | Comparative state scans, interpretive reasoning, regulatory signals | Citation-first, clause-by-clause with pinpoint references |
