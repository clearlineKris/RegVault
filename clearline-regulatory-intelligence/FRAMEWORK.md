# FRAMEWORK: Penumbrant + LOTL Methodology

We pair two complementary lenses so operators can see both the letter and the penumbra of cannabis regulation.

## Penumbrant (Gray-Area) Method
- **Signal scanning**: Track regulator speeches, advisory memos, emergency rules, and enforcement trends for drift and intent.
- **Ambiguity mapping**: Identify vague clauses, undefined terms, and inter-agency overlaps; stress-test them against real scenarios.
- **Stakeholder asymmetry**: Document where regulators, operators, and vendors hold different information and how that impacts risk.
- **Operator translation**: Turn gray-area insights into decision trees, risk postures, and scripts for regulator dialogues.

## LOTL (Letter of the Law) Method
- **Source harvesting**: Collect statutes, rules, bulletins, FAQs, and forms with citations and effective dates.
- **Clause-level structuring**: Break obligations into checklists aligned to workflows (licensing, cultivation, manufacturing, retail, transport).
- **Traceable evidence**: Maintain pinpoint citations, change logs, and audit trails for every requirement.
- **Ready-to-attach outputs**: Provide text you can drop into SOPs, training, and evidence binders without re-formatting.

## How they combine
1. **Baseline with LOTL** to establish non-negotiable obligations.
2. **Layer Penumbrant** to anticipate enforcement flex, gray gaps, and cross-state patterns.
3. **Decide posture**: choose conservative, balanced, or assertive stances depending on risk tolerance and market strategy.
4. **Operationalize**: convert both views into playbooks, scripts, and controls your teams can actually run.

Use this framework as you explore the previews in this repo: LOTL shows what you must do; Penumbrant shows where the ground may shift.
