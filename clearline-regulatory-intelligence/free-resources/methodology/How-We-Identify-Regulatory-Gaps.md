# How We Identify Regulatory Gaps (Penumbrant Method)

1. **Source sweep**: Monitor statutes, rules, FAQs, advisory bulletins, emergency rulemaking, and enforcement actions.
2. **Gap detection**: Flag undefined terms, conflicting clauses, cross-agency overlaps, and places where enforcement deviates from text.
3. **Scenario testing**: Run real operator scenarios (expansion, transport anomalies, tech failures) against the rules to find friction points.
4. **Signal weighting**: Score risks by likelihood, regulator posture, and stakeholder asymmetry.
5. **Operator translation**: Turn findings into scripts, decision trees, and mitigation options tied back to LOTL citations for defensibility.
