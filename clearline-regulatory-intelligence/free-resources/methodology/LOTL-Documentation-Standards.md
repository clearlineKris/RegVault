# LOTL Documentation Standards (Black-Letter Law)

- **Source fidelity**: Capture statute, rule, bulletin, and FAQ text with effective dates and citation pins.
- **Clause granularity**: Break requirements into clause-level obligations aligned to operational workflows.
- **Traceability**: Every checklist item links back to a citation; updates tracked in a change log with timestamps.
- **Evidence ready**: Provide fields for proof (screenshots, forms, signatures) so outputs drop directly into SOPs and audit binders.
- **Version control**: Maintain release notes and update cadence per jurisdiction to keep teams synchronized.
