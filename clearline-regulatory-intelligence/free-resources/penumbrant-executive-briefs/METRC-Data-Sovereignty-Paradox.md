## Introduction

### The Data Question
- Cannabis operators generate massive amounts of compliance data through METRC
- Critical question: Who owns this data—operators, states, or METRC (Franwell)?
- The stakes: Privacy, competitive intelligence, and federal prosecution risk

### METRC's Unique Position
- A private company (Franwell) operating government-mandated compliance infrastructure
- State contracts with Franwell create complex data custodianship arrangements
- No federal oversight of a system tracking federally-illegal activity

### The Sovereignty Problem
- Traditional data privacy frameworks don't account for mandatory reporting systems
- State sovereignty over cannabis regulation conflicts with federal illegality
- Ambiguities in who can access, use, and share METRC data

## Main Sections

### Section 1: Legal Framework and Contractual Ambiguities

#### 1.1 The Tripartite Data Relationship
- **Operators**: Generate data through business operations
- **States**: Mandate data collection for regulatory purposes
- **Franwell/METRC**: Technical custodian with proprietary platform control

#### 1.2 State-Franwell Contract Terms
- **Major Ambiguity**: Most state-METRC contracts are not publicly accessible
- Variations in data ownership clauses across state contracts
- Unclear provisions on data retention, deletion, and portability
- Licensing vs. ownership distinctions

#### 1.3 Operator Terms of Service
- Operators must accept METRC Terms of Service to access state-mandated system
- Limited negotiation power—it's effectively "agree or don't operate"
- Privacy policies may grant Franwell broad data usage rights
- Conflict between mandatory participation and voluntary agreement to terms

### Section 2: Privacy and Confidentiality Tensions

#### 2.1 Operator Business Confidentiality
- METRC data reveals:
  - Cultivation methods and yields
  - Supplier and customer relationships
  - Pricing strategies and margins
  - Inventory levels and product mixes
- **Ambiguity**: Are these protected as trade secrets or public regulatory data?

#### 2.2 State Public Records Laws
- Some jurisdictions treat regulatory data as public records subject to FOIA requests
- Other states grant confidentiality protections to business data
- Inconsistent application: When does compliance data become public information?

#### 2.3 Patient and Consumer Privacy
- Medical cannabis patient information flows through METRC in some states
- HIPAA may or may not apply depending on state medical program structure
- Tracking individual purchases raises consumer privacy concerns
- **Gap**: No clear federal privacy framework for cannabis data

### Section 3: Federal Access and Enforcement Implications

#### 3.1 The Fourth Amendment Question
- Can federal agencies access METRC data without warrants?
- Third-party doctrine: Data shared with states/METRC may have reduced privacy protections
- Stored Communications Act implications for cloud-based METRC data

#### 3.2 IRS and Tax Enforcement
- **Major Tension**: IRC 280E requires disallowing business deductions for illegal substances
- IRS could theoretically access METRC data to audit cannabis businesses
- Voluntary compliance vs. involuntary data sharing through regulatory systems

#### 3.3 DEA and Federal Prosecution Risk
- METRC provides a detailed roadmap for federal enforcement actions
- State-level compliance creates federal liability exposure
- Lack of clarity on data sharing protocols between states and federal agencies
- Role of federal memoranda (Cole Memo, rescissions) in data access policies

### Section 4: Data Access and Control Issues

#### 4.1 Operator Access Limitations
- Operators have limited ability to export or analyze their own historical data
- METRC API restrictions and costs limit third-party integration
- Data portability challenges when licenses transfer or businesses close

#### 4.2 Regulator Oversight and Audits
- States have real-time access to all operator data
- Scope of permissible regulatory surveillance unclear
- Predictive analytics and pre-emptive enforcement questions

#### 4.3 Franwell's Proprietary Interests
- METRC platform improvements may be based on aggregate operator data
- Unclear whether Franwell can monetize de-identified data
- Competitive advantage from insights gained across all operators in a state

### Section 5: Interstate Data Sharing and Compacts

#### 5.1 Current State of Data Sharing
- No interstate data sharing agreements for METRC systems currently exist
- Each state operates METRC as an isolated instance
- Cross-border product transfers lack unified tracking

#### 5.2 Potential Interstate Compact Models
- **Ambiguity**: Could states form data-sharing compacts without federal approval?
- Dormant Commerce Clause implications
- Precedents from other regulated industries (pharmacy monitoring programs, etc.)

#### 5.3 Federal Preemption Concerns
- If cannabis is federally rescheduled, would federal agencies gain automatic METRC access?
- Would existing state contracts with Franwell be invalidated?
- Transition scenarios and data sovereignty questions

### Section 6: Case Law and Precedents

#### 6.1 Carpenter v. United States (2018)
- Cell phone location data privacy ruling implications
- Could extend to detailed business activity data in METRC
- Third-party doctrine limitations

#### 6.2 State-Level Privacy Litigation
- Emerging case law on cannabis regulatory data access
- Public records requests for METRC data—outcomes vary by state
- Operator challenges to warrantless data access

#### 6.3 Administrative Law Precedents
- Chevron deference to state agency interpretations of data access rules
- Challenges to METRC as unconstitutional delegation to private entity
- Due process concerns in enforcement actions based on METRC data

### Section 7: Stakeholder Asymmetry Analysis

#### 7.1 Power Imbalances
- States negotiate contracts; operators have no seat at the table
- Franwell holds monopoly position with no competitive alternatives in METRC states
- Small operators lack legal resources to challenge data practices

#### 7.2 Information Asymmetries
- Operators don't know what data states can access or how it's used
- Lack of transparency in state-Franwell contractual terms
- No standardized disclosure requirements for data handling practices

#### 7.3 Market Distortions
- MSOs can afford sophisticated data management; small operators cannot
- Data access restrictions create compliance barriers to entry
- Competitive intelligence risks if data protections are inadequate

## Conclusion

### Summary of the Paradox
- Mandatory participation in a private data system for public regulatory purposes
- Unclear ownership split between operators, states, and METRC vendor
- Federal illegality complicates state data sovereignty claims
- No comprehensive legal framework for cannabis data privacy

### Implications for Operators
- Assume all METRC data is potentially accessible to federal authorities
- Implement parallel internal record-keeping systems
- Advocate for transparent state-vendor contracts and data protection policies
- Consider data minimization strategies where regulations permit

### Implications for Policymakers
- Need for explicit data ownership and privacy statutes
- Consideration of public utility models for compliance infrastructure
- Interstate coordination on data sharing protocols
- Federal reform's impact on existing data governance structures

### The Path Forward
- Calls for industry-led data governance standards
- Potential for blockchain or decentralized alternatives to centralized METRC
- Need for judicial clarification of data rights in mandatory compliance systems

### Navigating the Penumbra
- Practical guidance for operators in protecting business confidential information
- When to invoke trade secret protections vs. regulatory transparency
- Building trust with regulators while preserving privacy rights
