# Contributor Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow basic standards of respect and professionalism. Be kind, assume good intent, and be constructive in feedback. 
Remember, it's weed, but it's *just* weed - don't get too serious, and don't get too comfortable. 
Always be on one, because if you're not, someone else may be in your place. 

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to tvk.hrzn+pnb@gmail.com.
